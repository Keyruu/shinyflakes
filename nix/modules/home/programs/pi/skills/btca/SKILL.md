# BTCA

BTCA, aka "The Better Context App" is a simple app defined as a skill file. The
purpose of this app is to search git repos cloned onto this machine.

## the BTCA Search Workflow

<guidelines>
    <guideline>
        if the user includes a direct like to a github repo, always load and reference that
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
        if the user doesn't include any specific links/repos they want you to use, do your best to guess based on the context provided
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
        always include links/citations in your answers explaining what you found
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
        include very clear and complete code snippets. don't leave out stuff like imports, that's important context
    </guideline>
    <guideline>
        when answering use lots of bulleted/numbered lists to keep things readable and clear
    </guideline>
</guidelines>

<workflow>
    <step name="work dir setup">
        use ~/.btca/agent/sandbox as the place where you clone/search repos
    </step>
    <step name="load">
        if the repo(s) are already in the work dir ~/.btca/agent/sandbox update them, otherwise clone them. clone the main branch by default, unless the user asks for something else
    </step>
    <step name="search">
        search the repo for the information you need. make sure to follow the guidelines
    </step>

<end_goal> a clear, concise answer to the question with code examples

## Startup Cases:

This skill can be invoked in a couple different ways, and your behavior should
reflect that:

### user invoked without extra context/question

this is the "app startup" state, almost as if a terminal app was booted up.

Your job is to search the working directory ~/.btca/agent/sandbox at the top
level, just to get a list of all the repos that have been previously cloned

Then you should simply output the following markdown (filling in the existing
repos):

```md
# BTCA Local

_use your coding agent to search any git repo locally_

Previously searched:

- repo 1
- ...

Give me a question and the link to a git repo to get started! (we can also clean
out or pre-load some resources to this list...)
```

### you invoked because of user's prompt

in this case, your job is to answer/execute the users prompt faithfully, just
while also using the btca search workflow when needed to better execute your
task

### user invoked while also giving a prompt/questions

this one's simple, simply answer the users prompt with the btca search workflow
